* i don't make skin elements myself, i start with a base skin and add in a bunch of random elements from other skins i have at the time.

i would put older versions here, but since i'm a dumbfuck who didn't back up older versions i don't have then. it's okay though, i just used whatever version at the time and mixed the new version onto that, so everything from mokyu v1-v6 should be included in v7.
